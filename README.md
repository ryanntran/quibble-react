## Quibble!
This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### To run the app locally:
  1. Place the repository onto your local machine, either via `git clone` or downloading and unzipping the source code.
  2. Navigate to the folder of the master branch in terminal, command prompt, etc. and run `npm install`.
  3. Run the application with `npm start`.

Quibble is a small-scale social media app that allows users to make their voices heard. The web app enables users to
inuitively create their own posts (quibbles) and like (quib) the post of others. With its sleek design and quick responsiveness,
it has never been quite easier to pick up the megaphone and shout your thoughts from the rooftop. 

Using Google's firebase server for the backend, Quibble allows speedy, instantaneous data upload and retrieval to and from the backend.
Within the blink of an eye your posts will be available to view to users across the nation. 


So, what's your quibble?
